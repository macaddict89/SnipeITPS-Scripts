# SnipeitPS-InventoryComputer
This script uses Snazy2000's Powershell modules for SnipeIT and the SnipeIT API to automatically inventory computers.

Requires Snazy2000's SnipeitPS Module v1.0.58 or higher installed from the PSGallery

Working with SnipeIT v4.6.15 - build 4011 (master) - YMMV

Built to run interactively or through PDQ Deploy's Powershell wrapper (except that's not working currently).
